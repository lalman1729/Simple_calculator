Overview of the project-:

Project: Simple calculator

Objective This project is to design and implement a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is user-friendly, with a straightforward interface that allows users to input numbers, select operations, and view results easily. This project aims to enhance understanding of programming fundamentals, such as function creation, input handling, error management, and user interface design.

Key Activities 1)Implement Basic Functions: Write functions for each arithmetic operation. Ensure functions handle basic input and output correctly.

2)Develop Core Application Logic: Create the main logic to take user input, call the correct function based on the selected operation, and display results.

User Interface Development: Import library like import java.awt.*,import java.awt.event.ActionEvent,import java.awt.event.ActionListener, to create a simple graphical interface with buttons for operations and a display for results.
Programming language: Java
